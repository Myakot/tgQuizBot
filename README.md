# tgQuizBot

# Add a check to a specified group chat, so that bot would ONLY work in that group (tie to config.py)
# Commands to add? upcoming, rsvp, leaderboard, reminders, give user access to add/delete
# When will reminders be used? Possible to set up? A day or 2?
# Needs functionality to change quizz time/date/location if plans have changed
# Before release have to change this so only Quiz name would be displayed initially.
# Clicking on a name button would show the rest of the info in a message
# Check if it's possible to send this message as "silent" and most messages from this bot, barring reminders
# Need to fix pagination - first time it shows - it shows all quizzes until a button is pressed
# Add CLI loggers of user ids that do commands in the group chat, save as a log file somewhere

# Add reminders
# Add rsvp
# Add leaderboard
# Add upcoming
# Add list upcoming
# Decide where to deploy - Heroku?
# plan to cancel RSVPs
# admin features? Or just manually reset bot if needed
